# Robotic Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Foundations of Embodied Intelligence
Every feature must be grounded in the principles of embodied intelligence. This means that all systems must be designed with the understanding that the body shapes the mind and that interaction with the physical world is crucial for developing cognitive skills.

### II. Core AI and Control Systems
The project will prioritize the development of robust Core AI and Control Systems. This includes a focus on hierarchical, reactive, and hybrid control architectures, as well as the use of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and ROS 2.

### III. The Humanoid Specialization
The project will focus on humanoid robotics as a specialized subset of Physical AI. All designs should be optimized for the human-centric world, with a focus on bipedal locomotion and manipulation.

### IV. Biomechanics and Bipedal Locomotion
A deep understanding of human gait and balance is essential. The project will prioritize the implementation of dynamic and static walking algorithms, as well as Whole-Body Control (WBC) and balancing strategies.

### V. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Safety
The project is committed to safe physical interaction between humans and robots. This includes the use of compliance and impedance control, as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory frameworks for humanoid deployment.

### VI. Advanced Topics and Future Trends
The project will explore advanced topics such as soft robotics, decentralized multi-robot systems, and long-term autonomy.

## Additional Constraints

All development must be done in a simulated environment before being deployed to physical hardware.

## Development Workflow

The development process will follow a Red-Green-Refactor cycle. All code must be reviewed and approved by at least two other team members before being merged into the main branch.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance.
